# Minimum Distance Between Points

This Python script calculates the minimum Euclidean distance between points on a Cartesian plane.

## Usage

1. Define the list of points as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of a point:

```python
points = [(1, 5), (5, 8), (8, 1), (9, 5)]
```
2. Run the script, and it will calculate the distances between all pairs of points and store them in the `distances` list.
3. The minimum distance will be the smallest value in the `distances` list.
